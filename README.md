# Dmabuf Transport

dmabuf_transport is a package for zero-copy transport ROS message with Linux dma-buf file descriptor.

## Overview

[Dmabuf Transport](https://github.com/quic-qrb-ros/dmabuf_transport) provides a way to share data between different hardware accelerators and different ROS nodes with zero-copy.

It is built on ROS 2 [Type Adaption](https://ros.org/reps/rep-2007.html). It allows us to define methods for serializing directly to the user requested type, and/or using that type in intra-process communication without ever converting it.

We can define our adapted types with Linux dma-buf, and send dma-buf descriptor with ROS. Then use [ROS Composition](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Tutorials/Intermediate/Composition.html) to confirm ROS nodes running in a single process, it enables zero-copy over the pipeline.

> This package need Linux kernel 5.12+ and ROS Humble later version.
